# protonutils

protonutils is a CLI tool that provides different utilities to make using the [Proton][0] compatibility tool more easily. It has the following features:

* List games by configured Proton version
* Download latest and older [Proton-GE][1] releases
* Download latest and older [Luxtorpeda][3] releases
* Clean-up unused compatibility tools automatically
* Search for app ID by name
* Print or open compatdata and install directories by game name  
  (handy of you want to mess with savegames or mods, for example)
* Update assigned compatibility tool for one or more games

The commands `list`, `appid`, `compatdata`, `installdir`, and `compattool` do only work with (non-native) games that either have an explicit Proton/CompatTool mapping or have been started at least once with Proton.

## Download Binary

* [Latest version](https://github.com/nning/protonutils/releases/latest/download/protonutils) (Linux x86_64)  

Make sure, the downloaded binary is executable (e.g. by running `chmod +x protonutils`).

## Build on Arch Linux

There is a [package in the AUR][2].

    yay -S protonutils

## Manual Build

Minimal Go version is 1.17.

This step is only necessary if aforementioned binary does not suit your needs for some reason. Install [Go](https://golang.org/), make sure `$GOPATH` is set correctly, then run...

    go install github.com/nning/protonutils/cmd/protonutils@latest
    protonutils
