# protonutils

protonutils is a CLI tool that provides different utilities to make using the [Proton][0] compatibility tool more easy. It has the following features:

* List games by configured Proton version
* Download latest [Proton-GE][1] release
* Download older Proton-GE releases
* Clean-up unused runtimes automatically
* Search for app ID by name (works for games that are installed or have been installed)

## Download Binary

* [Latest version](https://github.com/nning/protonutils/releases/latest/download/protonutils) (Linux x86_64)  

Make sure, the downloaded binary is executable (e.g. by running `chmod +x protonutils`).

## Build & Run

This step is only necessary if aforementioned binary does not suit your needs for some reason. Install [Go](https://golang.org/), make sure `$GOPATH` is set correctly, then run...

    go install github.com/nning/protonutils/cmd/protonutils@latest
    protonutils
