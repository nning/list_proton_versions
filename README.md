# list-proton-versions

Lists configured Proton version per game. Can be useful to clean up old runtimes. (For now, only works if runtime configuration was overridden at least once.)

## TODO

* Request Steam API once for all app IDs not in cache
* Do games only appear as installed if they used non-default Proton at least once?
